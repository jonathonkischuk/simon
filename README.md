Classic Simon game.

Using jQuery and JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, the code randomly generates a number and links it to a number in our color array.
As the game goes, the game generates a sequence one color at a time, and after each new color, the user has to repeat the full sequence.
The score is kept track of at the top of the screen in terms of level.
If the user gets any part of the sequence wrong, it plays a set sound and flashes red momentarily.
